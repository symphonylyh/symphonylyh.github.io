> My GitHub blogs are meant for logging the progress during my Ph.D. work at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC), including course work, class and research projects, life (less likely though). Most of the contents are expected to be configuration or deployment details, and that's why I am starting this thread -- to organize these snafus systematically and liberate myself from odds and ends.

Well, first things first, how to start with all these?

## GitHub Repository
First create a repo named `symphonylyh.github.io` with prefix being your username. This is also the public link to the website.

Clone the repo, and empty it because we'll use pre-built themes. For example, [HTML5 up](https://html5up.net/), [Jekyll](http://jekyllthemes.org), [Hexo](https://hexo.io/themes/index.html).

The structure of these themes usually comes with a `_config.yml` file which is the global configuration YAML file, a `_posts` folder where you put the real meat `.md` files, and maybe an `img` folder that the images are located.

## Jekyll Setup
We can edit the `.md` and push to GitHub every time to view, but that's slow and leads to a messy version history. With Jekyll we can view the webpages locally.
Following [Jekyll on Windows](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/windows/#installation-via-rubyinstaller) and [RubyInstaller](https://stackify.com/install-ruby-on-windows-everything-you-need-to-get-going/) we should have Ruby installed. From [Jekyll Usage](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/), run
```sh
gem install jekyll bundler
bundle update # some compatibility issues may exist, try update
bundle install
# ------ one-time only -------- #
cd to github.io folder
bundle exec jekyll serve
# ------ every time ----------- #
```
Other issues include `GitHub Metadata: Error processing value 'description':` is due to the `_config.yml` file, try fill the description field with anything and the problem should be fixed.

After that, the website will be host locally at `http://localhost:4000`
